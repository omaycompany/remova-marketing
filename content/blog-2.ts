Here's how to defend against it.", [{ heading: "Types of Prompt Injection", content: "Direct injection embeds malicious instructions in user prompts. Indirect injection hides instructions in documents or web pages the AI reads. Jailbreaking manipulates the AI into ignoring safety training. Each requires different defense strategies." }, { heading: "Detection Methods", content: "Rule-based detection identifies known attack patterns. Semantic analysis detects intent-level manipulation. Input/output consistency checking verifies responses match expected behavior. Multi-stage verification uses separate AI models to validate primary model outputs." }, { heading: "Defense in Depth", content: "No single defense is sufficient. Layer multiple protections: input sanitization, system prompt hardening, output verification, anomaly detection, and user behavior monitoring.
